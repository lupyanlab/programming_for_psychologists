# This file converts all notebooks in the notebooks directory to html, for 
#  hosting on a static site.
#
# This script converts all notebooks from IPython Notebook
#  syntax to raw html. It then converts all internal links to point to
#  these html documents rather than documents served from
#  the IPython Notebook Viewer.
#
# All conversion steps that are particular to an individual deployment of the 
#  static html files are done separately, in modify_custom_html.sh.
#
# This is meant to make it easy for anyone to build a simple static site
#  focused on helping people learn to use Python.
#
# This code is meant to work well as a post-commit hook. That way the html files
#  are kept up to date with the raw notebooks. However, this script can be run
#  manually when you want an html snapshot of the notebooks.
#
# All html files are ignored by git.

# Sometimes this file is run on its own (from this directory),
#  sometimes from a post-commit hook (from another directory).
#  The if structure lets it run either way.
# This could be cleaned up, perhaps by setting the correct path to notebooks in
#  an if clause, and then running the code.
